# -SmartCart-Customer-Clustering-Smart-Recommendation-System
SmartCart is a Machine Learning-based customer segmentation and smart shopping cart analysis system that uses clustering algorithms to group customers based on purchasing behavior.
# Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
ML Algorithms

# Machine Learning Approach
The project uses K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups customers based on similarities in their shopping behavior.
Steps involved:
Data collection
Data preprocessing
Feature scaling and plotting
Finding optimal number of clusters
Model training
Cluster visualization and interpretation

# Use Case
Retail businesses can use SmartCart to identify high-value customers, occasional buyers, and discount-sensitive customers to design better marketing campaigns and increase profitability.
